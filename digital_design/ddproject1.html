<h1> Playboi Carti </h1>

<h2> His Life </h2>

<p> Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper. He is recognized for his experimental musical style, gothic fashion, and mysterious public persona. Born and raised in Atlanta, Carter was initially signed to local underground label Awful Records prior to signing with ASAP Mob's AWGE Label under Interscope Records.[7] After gaining a cult following early in his career, Carter gained mainstream attention in 2017. Carter's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles "Magnolia" and "Woke Up Like This" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio album Die Lit (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200.[8][9] Following a two-year hiatus with little new music released, Carter's highly anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became his first chart-topping release. </p>
<h2>Modeling </h2>

<p>Carter's fashion style is one of the main features of his public image. GQ has defined Carter as the "leader of a youth style", and said that he represents a stylistic midpoint between the "fashion gloss of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of Uzi Vert, and the playful camp of Yachty."[35] Carter's favorite designer is Raf Simons and favorite designer label is Balmain. Carter met Simons at a fashion show in New York City.[36] Carter is featured on the song "RAF" by A$AP Mob, which was dedicated to Raf Simons. The music video for the song included Carter, A$AP Rocky, and Quavo wearing rare Raf Simons-designed clothing.[37] Carter considers Kanye West and A$AP Rocky inspirations for his fashion style.[38] Carter has modeled numerous times, including for Louis Vuitton,[39] Kanye West's Yeezy Season 5,[40][41] VFiles,[42][43] and Drake's OVO Lookbook, alongside Ian Connor and John Ross.[44] He was in a commercial for Nike, Inc. and walked the runway for the late Virgil Abloh and his brand Off-White. He designs for Vlone.[citation needed] Carter is known for his vampire-inspired attire, making Rick Owens more mainstream. </p>
<h2>Musical Style</h2>
<p>Carter has been described as a "mumble rapper",[45] and his music as "playful, hard-hitting, and very melodic."[46] Complex called his style of rapping "spare and repetitive, more concerned with flow and catchy phrases."[47] Briana Younger at Pitchfork said that "Cartiâ€™s music is less about lyricism and more about atmosphere", going on to say that "whatever Carti lacks in substance he makes up in sheer audacity."[48]
Carter is known for his "baby voice" technique, characterized by his voice hitting high pitches with unclear pronunciations and frantic cadences.[49] He has used this technique on popular songs such as "Almeda" with Solange, "Earfquake" with Tyler, the Creator, and "Pissy Pamper" with Young Nudy and Pi'erre Bourne. The New York Times said Carti's rapping made it appear as if he was "more at ease with the performance of the role than with the actual act of rapping."[50] He uses Satanic imagery.[51] His style is influenced by vampire movies.[52] Lil Wayne inspired him to freestyle all of his raps.[53] He is influenced by A$AP Rocky, Kanye West and Jay-Z.[54] Carter is known for his rock star persona. His songs are often about tales of sex and drugs.</p>
